# Get Lost!
### Maze Game on Roblox
Written for Roblox, this game offers players 10 mazes of increasing difficulty to try to solve while navigating them in third person. The mazes are generated procedurally using Kruskal's algorithm, with the current day's timestamp used to seed the random generator, resulting in identical mazes being generated across all servers and a new set of mazes being generated each day.
### Note
This game is still a work-in-progress. There is still more work to be done on the monetization side of things. However, the core gameplay mechanics are fully implemented
